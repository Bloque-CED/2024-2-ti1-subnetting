# Functional Sorting Algorithms Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Integrative Task 1 for the course **Discrete Structures and Computing II**. The main objective is to apply the functional programming paradigm to implement and test several sorting algorithms. The implemented algorithms include:

- **HeapSort**
- **CountingSort**
- **RadixSort**

Each algorithm is implemented in the Scala programming language, utilizing immutable data structures and recursion. Additionally, unit tests have been designed and implemented to verify the correctness and efficiency of these algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **HeapSort**
   - A functional implementation of the HeapSort algorithm.
   - Utilizes a heap structure to sort the list of elements.

2. **CountingSort**
   - A functional implementation of the CountingSort algorithm.
   - Sorts elements by counting the frequency of each unique element.

3. **RadixSort**
   - A functional implementation of the RadixSort algorithm.
   - Sorts integers by processing each digit individually.


## sbt project compiled with Scala 3

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
